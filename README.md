# Geodash-3D

## About
This is a game somewhat inspired by the popular mobile game "Geometry Dash". 

I wanted to create this game as a way to test my knowledge with OpenGL so far (so far I have learned how to use textures and multiple models in OpenGL).

## Compile the project
To compile the project just run the following commands:

```
cmake -S geodash-3d -B geodash-3d/build
cd geodash-3d/build
make
```

After that, merely run the command `./geodash3` to run the executable and play the game!
